# Task: Fixing Website Fragmentation and Media Section Issues

The user reported that the **Press & Media** section on the home page is not displaying content correctly (showing translation keys) and suffers from poor readability. Additionally, a hydration error was observed. The user also expressed frustration with "fragmented development," noting that changes are not organically connected.

## Objectives

1. **Fix Home Media Section**: Ensure actual content is displayed using correct i18n keys and improve visual readability.
2. **Resolve Hydration Errors**: Investigate and fix the cause of hydration mismatches on the home page.
3. **Unify Media Components**: Ensure `MediaSection` (Home) and `MediaArchive` (Page) are consistent in logic and styling.
4. **Complete Home i18n**: Implement translations for the `FeaturedWork` section which is currently hardcoded.
5. **High-End Refinement**: Polish the typography and layout to ensure a "premium" feel as requested.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Press & Media section on home page displays translated titles and publications.
- [ ] Hydration error is resolved.
- [ ] `FeaturedWork` section is fully localized.
- [ ] All media-related components share consistent logic (e.g., icon mappings).
- [ ] Visual polish: consistent line heights, font weights, and spacing across all sections.
